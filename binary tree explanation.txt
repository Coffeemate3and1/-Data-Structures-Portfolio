Node Class: 

Defines the structure of a node in a binary tree with integer values for 
keys and references to left and right child nodes.

BinaryTree Class: Encapsulates the binary tree logic.

 *Constructors initialize the binary tree, optionally with a root key or a default empty tree.
 *Contains an inorderTraversal method to perform an inorder traversal recursively:

Main Method:

*Initializes a binary tree with a root node having a key of 1.
*Manually constructs a binary tree by assigning left and right child nodes to the root and its descendants.
*The constructed tree has the following structure:


Performs an inorder traversal starting from the root and prints the elements in ascending order (inorder).
The output demonstrates the inorder traversal of the binary tree.
