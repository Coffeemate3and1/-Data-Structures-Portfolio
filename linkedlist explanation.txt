The code defines a linked list where each node holds an integer value.
The LinkedList class provides methods to insert elements at the end of the list and display the contents of the list.
In the main method, it demonstrates inserting elements into the linked list (2, 4, and 6) and then displays the contents of the list.
The output will show: Linked List elements: 2 4 6, indicating the three elements in the linked list in the order they were inserted.
