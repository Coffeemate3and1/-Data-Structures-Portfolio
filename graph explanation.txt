Explanation:

Graph Class:

Graph class represents an undirected graph using an adjacency list.
It contains:
V: The number of vertices in the graph.
adjacencyList: An array of LinkedList where each index corresponds to a vertex and stores its adjacent vertices.
Constructor:

Graph(int V): Initializes the graph with the given number of vertices (V). It creates an empty adjacency list for each vertex.
addEdge() Method:

void addEdge(int v, int w): Adds an edge between vertices v and w.
It does this by adding w to the adjacency list of v and v to the adjacency list of w, as it is an undirected graph.
printGraph() Method:

void printGraph(): Displays the adjacency list representation of the graph.
It iterates through each vertex's adjacency list and prints the adjacent vertices.
main() Method:

Initializes a graph with 5 vertices.
Adds edges between these vertices using addEdge() method.
Finally, it displays the adjacency list representation of the graph using printGraph() method.
This code creates a simple undirected graph with 5 vertices and adds edges between them based on the addEdge() calls. It then prints out the adjacency list representation for each vertex in the graph using the printGraph() method.
