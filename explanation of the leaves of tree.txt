The Main class initializes the root of the tree and contains a method countLeaf to recursively count the leaf nodes in the binary tree.
In the main method of the Main class, a binary tree is constructed by creating nodes and linking them together.
The countLeaf method recursively counts the leaf nodes (nodes with no children) in the binary tree.
Finally, the code prints out the total number of leaf nodes in the tree as the output.
