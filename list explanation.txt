It first prompts the user to input data for several nodes and then creates a circular 
linked list with these nodes. The add function adds new nodes to the circular linked list, 
and the display function prints the nodes of the list. Finally, the code calculates and 
displays the sum of the data stored in all nodes of the circular linked list.
