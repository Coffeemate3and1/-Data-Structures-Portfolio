
The code implements a stack data structure in Java using an array. 
It initializes a stack with a specified size and provides methods 
to perform typical stack operations such as push, pop, check if the 
stack is empty or full, get the size, and print the elements. 
The main method demonstrates the stack operations by creating a stack,
 pushing elements, displaying the elements, showing the top element,
 popping elements, and displaying the remaining elements after popping.
